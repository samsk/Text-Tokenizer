Text::Tokenizer version 0.2
============================

Text::Tokenizer is fast lexical analyzer for processing text files. Using this 
  module you can create fast and clean config readers with few lines of code.
  Note: This module obsoletes/replaces my old and very ugly RcReader module
	(I hope nobody used it except of me :)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module is based on the code generated by flex (http://lex.sourceforge.net),
if it fails compile you should install flex (if you already didn't) and run:

  make -f Makefile.flex

that will re-generate module sources.
